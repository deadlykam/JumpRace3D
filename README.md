# JumpRace3D

### Introduction of the game:
This is a mobile game where the player races with other AI by jump on floating stages.

## Gameplay:
The main objective is to get to the final floating stage which is green in colour and looks different from other stages. On the way there will be other AI racers that will try to reach the final stage before the player. The AI racers can be killed by colliding with them or by breaking some stages. The player dies when falling into the water or colliding with the big floating windmill fan obstacle. There is a booster pick up which helps the player to travel further. Once the player reachs the final stage a new random stage will be generated.
